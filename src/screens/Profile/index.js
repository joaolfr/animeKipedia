              Call me John! I'm a guy who likes to enjoy every day, and not just
              wait for the weekend! And I'm proud of it. I'm married and I want
              to have 2 kids in a few years :) I have the dream of visiting
              Turkey and flying a balloon with my wife. I live in a coastal
              city, and I go to the beach a lot. I love riding my bike and
              eating a food called "feijoada" I've played dota 2 for a long
              time, but after getting angry I stopped XD

                I have a degree in computer science, and I've been working as a
                programmer since 2017. I've had experience in several areas,
                such as Java, python, Django but I'm passionate about front end,
                especially Mobile, and I've been working with it for over two
                years. I have focused my studies only on mobile technologies,
                mainly react native, to become an expert in the area.
